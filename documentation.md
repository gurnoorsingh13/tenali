# Feature AQ — Tap-to-Define Word Glossary

## Problem Statement

Quiz question prompts in Tenali often contain mathematical vocabulary (e.g. *denominator*, *hypotenuse*, *probability*) that younger students may not know. Previously there was no in-context help — a student who didn't understand a word in a question had to leave the app to look it up, breaking focus and flow.

---

## Goals

- Allow students to tap any recognized math term directly inside a question prompt to see a plain-English definition
- Require zero server changes — purely a client-side enhancement
- Be non-intrusive: prompts without recognized terms must render identically to before
- Work on both mobile (tap) and desktop (click)

---

## Functional Requirements

- Recognized terms in a question prompt are shown with a dotted underline
- Tapping an underlined term opens an inline popover showing the term's canonical name and definition
- Only the **first occurrence** of each term per prompt is interactive; duplicates render as plain text
- Only **one popover is open at a time** — opening a second term closes the first
- Popovers close when: the user clicks/taps outside, presses Escape, taps the same term again, or after a 6-second auto-dismiss timer
- Multi-word terms (e.g. "prime number") are recognized as a single entry, not as two separate words
- Aliases and simple plurals are recognized (e.g. "vertices" → "vertex" definition)
- If a question prompt contains no recognized terms, it renders as plain text with zero overhead

---

## Implementation Overview

The feature is contained in two new files and small modifications to existing files:

1. **`client/src/data/glossaryTerms.json`** — a static JSON array of term definitions
2. **`client/src/components/GlossaryText.jsx`** — a React component that tokenizes a prompt string and renders interactive term spans
3. **`client/src/App.jsx`** — `GlossaryText` imported and used as a drop-in replacement wherever `{question.prompt}` or `{question.question}` was rendered as plain text in word-problem quizzes
4. **`client/src/App.css`** — CSS classes for the glossary visual treatment

---

## Data Flow

```
glossaryTerms.json
       │
       ▼  (parsed at module load, outside components)
  matchMap: { lowercase_form → { term, definition } }
       │
       ▼  (sorted longest-first, escaped, joined)
  glossaryRegex: /\b(prime number|perimeter|...|area)\b/gi
                         (built once, shared across all GlossaryText instances)
       │
       ▼  (on each render, via useMemo when text prop changes)
  segments: Array<
    { type: 'text', value: string }
    | { type: 'term', id, displayText, term, definition }
  >
       │
       ├── 'text' segments → plain strings in JSX
       └── 'term' segments → <GlossaryTooltip> (underline + popover)
                                      │
                                      ▼
                             openId state in <GlossaryText>
                             (null = no popover; number = index of open term)
```

---

## Components

### `GlossaryText` (default export from `GlossaryText.jsx`)

Public-facing component. Accepts a single `text` prop (the raw question prompt string).

- Runs `glossaryRegex` against `text` via `useMemo` (recalculates only when `text` changes)
- Manages `openId` state — which term's popover is open (`null` = none)
- If no matches exist, falls back to `<>{text}</>` with no extra DOM nodes

**Usage:**
```jsx
<GlossaryText text={question.prompt} />
// or
<GlossaryText text={question.question} />
```

### `GlossaryTooltip` (internal, not exported)

Renders one underlined interactive term and its popover.

- Receives controlled `isOpen` + `onToggle` from parent
- Three `useEffect`s: outside-click listener, Escape-key listener, 6-second auto-dismiss
- Uses a 10 ms delay before attaching the outside-click listener so the click that opened the popover doesn't immediately close it
- Fully accessible: `role="button"`, `tabIndex={0}`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-label`, keyboard activation on Enter/Space

### Module-level constants (not React components)

- **`matchMap`** — built once at module load from `glossaryTerms.json`. Key: lowercase form. Value: `{ term: canonical, definition }`.
- **`glossaryRegex`** — single `RegExp` built from all keys in `matchMap`, sorted longest-first, word-boundary-anchored, case-insensitive, global flag.

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `client/src/components/GlossaryText.jsx` | Component + all logic (225 lines) |
| `client/src/data/glossaryTerms.json` | 40 term definitions |
| `client/src/App.jsx` | Import + 11 wiring sites |
| `client/src/App.css` | ~105 lines of new CSS |

**Quiz sites wired in `App.jsx`:**

| App / Factory | Line (approx.) | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `ConceptApp` | ~36491 | `question.question` |
| `VocabApp` | ~38961 | `question.question` |
| `makeMCQuizApp` factory | ~39257 | `question.prompt` |
| `makeQuizApp` factory | ~39498 | `question.prompt` |
| `DotProdApp` (fallback) | ~39857 | `question.prompt` |
| `GymApp` | ~40801 | `question.prompt` |
| `SetsApp` | ~42318 | `getPromptForType(...)` |
| `SequencesApp` | ~42514 | `question.prompt` |
| `RatioApp` | ~42667 | `question.prompt` |
| `PercentApp` | ~42836 | `question.prompt` |
| `IndicesApp` | ~43004 | `question.prompt` |

**Explicitly excluded** (pure math-expression renders, no prose):
- Any line rendering `{question.prompt} = ?` — these are arithmetic/log/index notation strings, not natural-language sentences.

---

## Design Decisions

**Longest-match-first regex**
Terms are sorted by length descending before building the regex alternation. This ensures `prime number` is matched as a whole before the single word `prime` could match.

**First-occurrence-only highlighting**
The `seen` Set inside the `useMemo` in `GlossaryText` tracks which base terms have already been tokenized as interactive. Subsequent occurrences become plain text. This keeps prompts readable and avoids cluttering every instance of a common word like "factor".

**Regex built once at module load**
Building the regex inside a component would re-create it on every render. Instead it is built at module scope, so all `GlossaryText` instances share the same compiled regex object.

**`useMemo` on `segments`**
The tokenization (regex + loop) runs only when `text` changes. For a static question prompt that re-renders (e.g. due to parent state changes), the work is skipped.

**Single `openId` state**
Rather than each `GlossaryTooltip` managing its own open state, the parent `GlossaryText` holds `openId`. This ensures only one popover is open at a time without any cross-component messaging.

**No hover interaction**
Feature AQ spec Section 9 requires mobile-first interaction. Hover states are intentionally omitted. The dotted underline + icon communicates interactivity without hover.

**Fail-safe JSON load**
The entire `matchMap` construction is in a `try/catch`. If `glossaryTerms.json` fails to parse, `matchMap` stays empty and `glossaryRegex` is `null`. In that case `GlossaryText` returns plain text. No crash.

---

## Edge Cases

| Case | Handling |
|---|---|
| Term appears multiple times in prompt | First occurrence is interactive; rest are plain text |
| Term with alias (e.g. "vertices") | Alias is registered in `matchMap` pointing to the canonical definition |
| Simple plural not in aliases (e.g. "factors") | Auto-registered at module load for single-word terms not ending in `s` |
| Prompt string is empty or non-string | `GlossaryText` returns `<>{text}</>` via early-return guard |
| No terms match | Segments array is all-text; returns `<>{text}</>` with no extra DOM |
| Popover near right edge of screen | Currently unhandled — CSS `left: 50%; transform: translateX(-50%)` centers it over the term, which may clip on narrow screens |
| Math-only prompt (`= ?` expressions) | Not wired — these quiz sites deliberately excluded |
| User opens popover and question auto-advances | `useEffect` in `GlossaryText` resets `openId` to `null` whenever `text` prop changes |

---

## Limitations

- **~40 terms** — only the most common GCSE-level math terms are currently defined. The corpus likely contains many more terms students might not know.
- **`\b` word boundaries only** — hyphenated terms like `right-angled` are not matched. The regex would match `right` but that has no glossary entry, so it's benign, but `right-angled` itself cannot be a glossary term without a custom tokenizer.
- **Popover may clip on small screens** — no floating-UI / Popper.js positioning logic. Future work.
- **No persistence** — there is no tracking of which terms a student has looked up. A future feature could log term lookups for analytics.
- **No search/index** — there is no standalone glossary index page. Terms are only surfaced contextually in quiz prompts.

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand `glossaryTerms.json` to 100+ terms covering the full GCSE curriculum
- Add a standalone "Glossary" page listing all terms alphabetically, accessible from the home screen
- Use a floating-UI library (e.g. `@floating-ui/react`) for smart popover positioning that avoids viewport clipping
- Track term lookups in analytics to identify which terms students find confusing most often
- Add "did you know" secondary facts to some definitions
- Consider fuzzy matching for common misspellings in student-generated content

---

## Testing

The feature was manually tested in the browser (Vite dev server at `http://localhost:5173/`):
- ConceptApp: tapped "probability" → popover appeared with correct definition
- VocabApp: word-definition prompt highlighted glossary terms correctly
- `makeMCQuizApp` factory apps (e.g. Probability, Stats, Mensuration): `question.prompt` terms highlighted
- `makeQuizApp` factory apps: short-answer prompt terms highlighted
- Prompts with no glossary terms: rendered identically to before, no extra DOM
- Multi-word: "prime number" matched as one unit, not as "prime" alone
- Alias: tested "vertices" — shows "vertex" canonical definition
- Auto-dismiss: popover closed after 6 seconds without interaction
- Escape key: popover closed
- Outside click: popover closed
- Multiple taps: toggled open/closed correctly; only one popover open at a time

No automated tests exist.

## Version History

### v1.0

Date: 2026-07-08

Summary: Initial implementation of Feature AQ — Tap-to-Define Word Glossary. Component (`GlossaryText.jsx`), data (`glossaryTerms.json`, 40 terms), CSS, and wiring into 11 quiz prompt sites across both factory-generated and standalone apps.

Files Changed:
- `client/src/components/GlossaryText.jsx` (new)
- `client/src/data/glossaryTerms.json` (new)
- `client/src/App.jsx` (modified — import + 11 prompt sites)
- `client/src/App.css` (modified — ~105 lines added)

Notes: Changes are uncommitted on branch `feat/tap-to-define-word-glossary`. Deployed to production pending commit + build.

---

### v1.1 (Phase 2 — coverage expansion)

Date: 2026-07-09

Summary: Expanded Feature AQ coverage. Wired 3 additional prose-style prompt sites that the initial implementation missed (CustomApp default branch, Tatsavit1App, RiyaApp) and grew the glossary term dictionary from 40 to **250 unique terms** covering virtually the entire GCSE/IGCSE math vocabulary. No component or CSS changes — `GlossaryText.jsx` and `App.css` are unchanged in this phase.

Files Changed:
- `client/src/App.jsx` (modified — 3 new `<GlossaryText>` wirings at lines 46942, 48264, 49031)
- `client/src/data/glossaryTerms.json` (modified — 40 → 250 unique entries)

Breaking Changes: None.

Migration Required: None — purely additive.

Wiring sites after v1.1 (14 total):

| # | Line | App | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 36491 | `GKApp` | Phase 1 |
| 2 | 38961 | `VocabApp` | Phase 1 |
| 3 | 39257 | `makeMCQuizApp` factory | Phase 1 |
| 4 | 39498 | `makeQuizApp` factory | Phase 1 |
| 5 | 39857 | `DotProdApp` (fallback branch) | Phase 1 |
| 6 | 40801 | `GymApp` | Phase 1 |
| 7 | 42318 | `RandomMixApp` | Phase 1 |
| 8 | 42514 | `SetsApp` | Phase 1 |
| 9 | 42667 | `SequencesApp` | Phase 1 |
| 10 | 42836 | `RatioApp` | Phase 1 |
| 11 | 43004 | `PercentApp` | Phase 1 |
| 12 | 46942 | `CustomApp` (default branch) | **Phase 2** — wraps `getPromptForType(curType, question) \|\| ''` |
| 13 | 48264 | `Tatsavit1App` | **Phase 2** — wraps `q.prompt \|\| ''` |
| 14 | 49031 | `RiyaApp` | **Phase 2** — wraps `q.prompt \|\| ''` |

Phase 2 design decisions:

- **Empty-string fallback (`... || ''`)** used on all 3 new wirings to safely handle `null`/`undefined` returns from helpers (e.g. `getPromptForType` can return `null` for some puzzle types).
- **Trig tangent renames** to canonical `tangent line` with alias `tan`, to avoid clobbering the existing geometry `tangent` canonical in `matchMap`. Both definitions are now preserved under distinct canonicals.
- **Duplicate removal:** Removed redundant copies of `net` (geometry), `reciprocal` (number operations), and the redundant `index` entry (whose aliases were already on the existing `exponent` entry). Removed a self-alias `factorise` for cleanliness.
- **No changes** to `GlossaryText.jsx`, `App.css`, `server/index.js`, `package.json`, or `vite.config.js`.

Glossary term count by category after v1.1:

| Category | Approx. count |
|---|---|
| Geometry (shapes, lines, angles, circle parts, triangles, transformations) | ~70 |
| Algebra (expressions, equations, identities, inequalities, formulas, functions, quadratics, asymptotes) | ~30 |
| Number & Arithmetic (types, fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios, BODMAS, rounding, number operations) | ~50 |
| Statistics & Probability (data terms, charts, probability events) | ~30 |
| Trigonometry (sin/cos/tan, identities, bearings) | ~17 |
| Calculus (limits, derivatives, integrals, stationary points) | ~15 |
| Vectors & Matrices | ~10 |
| Sets (union, intersection, complement) | ~8 |
| Logarithms & Exponentials | ~6 |
| Money & Business | ~9 |
| Measurement (speed/distance/time/rate/unit) | ~5 |
| Sign concepts (positive, negative, absolute value) | ~3 |

New limitations introduced in v1.1: None (existing Phase 1 limitations unchanged).

New limitations: The geometry `tangent` canonical no longer has a `"tan"` alias (since `"tan"` is reserved for the trig entry under `tangent line`). In trig prompts containing `"tan"`, the displayed definition is the trig `tangent line` one, which is correct; in geometry prompts containing `"tangent"`, the geometry definition is displayed, which is also correct.

Testing performed: Manual review only (no automated tests exist for this feature). The user instructed that the dev server and backend remain running for the duration of the session, so no verification commands were executed.

### v1.2 (Phase 3 — Pre-quiz "Learn These Words" section)

Date: 2026-07-09

Summary: Added a NEW complementary feature — a "Learn These Words" section on every math topic's setup page (before "Start Quiz"). Lists 3-9 curated glossary terms per topic; tapping a term opens the **exact same popover** used inside quiz questions. Strictly additive: zero changes to existing in-question glossary behavior, no new dependencies, single glossary system preserved. Backed by a new lightweight `topicGlossaryMap.json` that references canonical term keys (no definitions duplicated).

Files Changed:
- `client/src/data/topicGlossaryMap.json` (**new** — 64 topics × 3-9 term references = 326 references)
- `client/src/components/KeyTerms.jsx` (**new** — section component, ~60 lines)
- `client/src/components/GlossaryText.jsx` (modified — 3 small additions: `export` on `matchMap`, optional `wrapperClassName` prop on `GlossaryTooltip`, class-name concatenation in wrapper span. **Zero behavior changes** to existing in-question glossary.)
- `client/src/App.jsx` (modified — added `import KeyTerms`; added `topicKey` to both factory signatures; added `<KeyTerms topicKey="..." />` to 21 standalone welcome-boxes + 2 factories' welcome-boxes; added `topicKey: '...'` to 44 factory call configs)
- `client/src/App.css` (modified — added `.glossary-term-wrapper--above` flip rule + `@keyframes glossary-appear-above` + `.learn-these-words-section` / `.learn-these-words-title` / `.learn-these-words-list` + chip-style overrides on existing `.glossary-term`. ~65 new lines, all using existing CSS variables.)

Breaking Changes: None.

Migration Required: None — purely additive.

Architecture:

```
glossaryTerms.json  (definitions, single source of truth, 250 terms)
        │
        ▼
GlossaryText.jsx   matchMap built once at module load
        │
        ├─ exports matchMap, GlossaryTooltip
        │
        ├── <GlossaryText>     (in-question prose renderer; 14 wiring sites)
        │
        └── <KeyTerms>         (pre-quiz section renderer; 65 wiring sites)
                │
                └── reads topicGlossaryMap.json
                        │
                        └── { "trigonometry": ["sine", "cosine", "tangent line", ...], ... }
```

**One glossary system invariant**: every term definition, popover rendering, and outside-click/Escape/auto-dismiss/keyboard behavior is implemented exactly once, in `GlossaryText.jsx` / `App.css`. `KeyTerms` reuses the exported `GlossaryTooltip` directly. Updating a definition in `glossaryTerms.json` automatically updates both the in-question glossary and the pre-quiz section.

Design decisions:

- **`wrapperClassName` prop, not a refactor** — Rather than extract a new shared component, a single optional `wrapperClassName` prop was added to `GlossaryTooltip`. Default `''` keeps all 14 in-question call sites unaffected; only `KeyTerms` passes `"glossary-term-wrapper--above"` to flip the popover upward.
- **Topic keys are kebab-case human-readable names** (e.g. `coordinate-geometry`, `pythagoras-theorem`, `prime-factors`) — not the internal `regularApps[i].key` abbreviations (e.g. `coordgeom`). Each app's welcome-box or factory call explicitly passes the readable key, keeping `topicGlossaryMap.json` browseable.
- **Section placement is "middle" of the welcome-box** (after welcome-text and optional tip, before difficulty picker) per the spec.
- **Popover position is "always above" for this section** — not conditional viewport-flip. The section lives near the bottom of the welcome-box where the Start Quiz button sits, so the popover should always open upward. CSS-only `position: absolute; bottom: calc(100% + 7px)` is simpler, equally correct for the placement, and renders identically across devices.
- **Silent skip for missing terms** — `KeyTerms` filters `matchMap[key.toLowerCase()]` results and drops `undefined` entries. Topics where every term is missing render `null` (section hidden). Per the spec edge case: "If a glossary term cannot be found, skip it without breaking the UI."
- **Auto-skipped duplicate synonyms** — internal `seen` Set dedupes by `entry.term.toLowerCase()`. If `tangent` and `tan` are both listed, only the first renders.
- **Curated 3-9 terms per topic** (not a hard cap) — chosen to match each topic's vocabulary density. Most topics have 3-8 terms; outliers: mensuration (9), sets (9), coordinate-geometry (8), probability (8), statistics (8), matrices (8), transformations (8), trigonometry (8), differentiation (8).

Wiring sites (65 total in Phase 3):

- **21 standalone math quiz welcome-boxes** — each had `<KeyTerms topicKey="<key>" />` added directly after the existing `<p className="welcome-text">…</p>`.
- **2 factory welcome-boxes** (`makeQuizApp` and `makeMCQuizApp`) — each had `{topicKey && <KeyTerms topicKey={topicKey} />}` added directly after the optional tip line.
- **44 factory call configs** — each had `topicKey: '<kebab-case>'` added alongside the existing `title`/`subtitle`/`apiPath`/`diffLabels`/`placeholders` properties.

Curated topics (64 total, 3-9 terms each):

| Group | Topics | Count |
|---|---|---|
| Geometry | angles, triangles, polygons, circle-theorems, transformations, mensuration, pythagoras-theorem, similarity, congruence, herons-formula, bearings | 11 |
| Algebra | linear-equations, quadratics, quadratic-formula, simultaneous-equations, inequalities, polynomial-multiplication, polynomial-factorisation, binomial-theorem, remainder-theorem, basic-arithmetic, multiplication, addition, expansion (= indices) | 13 |
| Number | fractions, decimals, percentages, ratios, surds, indices, square-roots, standard-form, rounding, number-bases, prime-factors, hcf-and-lcm, variation, bounds, shares-and-dividends, banking, profit-and-loss, gst | 18 |
| Functions | functions, coordinate-geometry, line-equation, trigonometry, inverse-trigonometry, differentiation, integration, limits, differential-equations, calculus (via differentiation/integration) | 9 |
| Statistics | statistics, probability, sets, sequences, vectors, matrices, dot-products, sequences | 8 |
| Money/measurement | speed-distance-time, perimeter (via mensuration), area (via mensuration) | 1 (others via mensuration) |
| Misc | section-formula, linear-programming, circular-measure, conic-sections, linear-programming, squaring | 5 |

(Note: some topics overlap in scope — total 64 unique topic keys.)

Intentionally NOT wired (per user spec — section would auto-hide for some but skipped entirely to keep this change minimal):
- CustomApp, RandomMixApp, GymApp, TatsavitApp, Tatsavit1App, RiyaApp, TatsavitLineApp, BridgeApp, TenthApp, Chapter1-24App, GuessNumberApp, TwinHuntApp
- The 7 Gym-* MCQ factory apps (GymDecimals, FuncGym, DotProdGym, FracAddGym, LinEqGym, IndicesGym, PolyGym)
- GKApp, VocabApp (would auto-hide since no entries for their keys)

Limitations introduced in v1.2: None — feature is purely additive.

Pre-existing limitations (from Phase 1/2) carried forward unchanged.

Testing performed: Manual review via verification script (since removed) — all 326 term-key references across 64 topics resolve to entries in `glossaryTerms.json`. 6 entries were silently dropped during development (clockwise, side, regular polygon, direct/inverse proportion, binomial-as-standalone) and removed from `topicGlossaryMap.json`. No automated tests exist for this feature. User instructed that the dev server and backend remain running for the duration of the session, so no live browser tests were executed.

### v1.3 (Phase 3 follow-up — disclosure pattern refinement)

Date: 2026-07-09

Summary: Refined the Phase 3 "Learn These Words" feature from an always-visible chips box into a calm disclosure pattern: a small `Learn These Words (N) ▾` toggle button that opens an anchored, lightweight panel listing the terms. The existing glossary popup for individual word definitions is reused unchanged — still one glossary system, one source of truth for definitions.

Files Changed:
- `client/src/components/KeyTerms.jsx` (**rewritten** — ~150 lines, was ~80. Default export and `topicKey` prop interface unchanged, so `App.jsx` and the 65 wirings require no changes.)
- `client/src/App.css` (**replaced** entire `.learn-these-words-*` CSS block, was ~65 lines, now ~85 lines)

Breaking Changes: None.

Migration Required: None.

Architecture (unchanged from v1.2):
- Single glossary system preserved — `glossaryTerms.json` remains the only definition source
- `matchMap` and `GlossaryTooltip` from `GlossaryText.jsx` are reused directly
- The popover for each chip is the SAME `GlossaryTooltip` used inside quiz questions
- Updating a definition in `glossaryTerms.json` still updates both surfaces

Component behaviour:

- Renders a `<button className="learn-these-words-toggle">` with format `Learn These Words ({N}) ▾`. The count `(N)` always appears (whenever the section renders, `N ≥ 1` because the filter short-circuits to `null` at 0). The caret `▾` is a Unicode `▾` glyph. Rotates 180° via CSS `transform: rotate(180deg)` when `aria-expanded="true"`.
- Clicking the toggle reveals a `<div className="learn-these-words-panel">` directly below the toggle, anchored via CSS `position: absolute; top: calc(100% + 6px); left: 0`. Panel layout is vertical list; each entry is a `<TermChip>`.
- Each `<TermChip>` is a self-contained state wrapper that manages local popover open/close state and renders the existing exported `GlossaryTooltip` with a `wrapperClassName` chosen at toggle-open time based on `getBoundingClientRect().top` — if `< 120`, `wrapperClassName=""` (default = opens below), otherwise `"glossary-term-wrapper--above"` (opens above).
- Panel closes on: (a) re-clicking the toggle, (b) document mousedown/touchstart outside the wrapper (with the same 10 ms setTimeout pattern used inside `GlossaryTooltip`), (c) `Escape` key. Pattern matches the GlossaryTooltip behavior.
- Popover behaviour is unchanged from v1.2 — reuses existing controlled-state `GlossaryTooltip`. Closing the popover via outside-click / Escape / 6 s auto-dismiss does NOT close the panel.

Visual design (CSS additions / changes):

- `.learn-these-words` — invisible anchor (`position: relative; margin: 0 0 16px 0;`), no background, border, or radius. Carries no visual weight.
- `.learn-these-words-toggle` — text-button style. `background: transparent; color: var(--clr-text-soft); font: inherit; font-size: 0.95rem; font-weight: 500; min-height: 44px; padding: 0 14px; border-radius: var(--radius-sm);` Brightens to `--clr-text` on hover/focus; gains a 2px accent-soft focus ring via `box-shadow`. `aria-expanded="true"` makes the text darker again for visual confirmation.
- `.learn-these-words-caret` — inline-block span with `transform: rotate(180deg)` when the toggle has `aria-expanded="true"`.
- `.learn-these-words-panel` — `position: absolute; top: calc(100% + 6px); left: 0; z-index: 100; min-width: 240px; max-width: min(480px, calc(100vw - 32px)); max-height: calc(100vh - 200px); overflow-y: auto;` then `background: var(--clr-card); border: 1px solid var(--clr-border); border-left: 3px solid var(--clr-accent); border-radius: var(--radius-sm); padding: 14px 18px; box-shadow: var(--shadow-card); animation: glossary-appear-above 0.13s ease;` — reuses the existing animation keyframe (which does `translateY(5px) → 0` + opacity), and every color/spacing token from the existing design system.
- `.learn-these-words-list` — `display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 6px;` (vertical list).
- `.learn-these-words-list .glossary-term` — list-item style: `display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; width: 100%; background: var(--clr-card); border: 1px solid var(--clr-border); border-radius: var(--radius-sm); padding: 12px 16px; min-height: 44px; font-size: 0.98rem; color: var(--clr-text);` deliberately NOT a pill (`border-radius: var(--radius-sm)`, not 999px) and slightly taller than the previous chips for finger-friendly touch.
- `.learn-these-words-list .glossary-term-icon` — `display: none` (hides the 📖 emoji that the existing in-question `.glossary-term` shows).
- `.learn-these-words-list .glossary-term::after` — adds a `›` chevron (Unicode) with `opacity: 0.5; transition: opacity, transform;`; brightens to `opacity: 1; transform: translateX(3px);` on hover/focus for affordance feedback.
- `.learn-these-words-list .glossary-term:hover, .learn-these-words-list .glossary-term:focus-visible` — `background: var(--clr-accent-soft); border-color: var(--clr-accent); color: var(--clr-accent);` reuses the existing chip-highlight tokens.
- `.learn-these-words-list .glossary-term--open` — same highlight (existing GlossaryTooltip `--open` pattern).

Accessibility:

- `aria-expanded` on the toggle button (true / false)
- `aria-controls="learn-these-words-panel-{topicKey}"` on the toggle button, with the panel's `id` matching
- `role="region"` and `aria-label="Glossary terms for this topic"` on the panel
- `aria-hidden="true"` on the decorative caret `▾` character
- Keyboard: Enter / Space toggles the panel and individual chips; Escape closes panel and / or popover
- Focus ring on the toggle button via `box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px var(--clr-accent-soft);` on `:focus-visible`
- Min-height 44px on both toggle button and each chip — comfortable touch targets

Fail-safe (per user Q14):

- The entire data-resolution block (`validEntries` filter) is wrapped in `try/catch`. If the loop throws — for example, malformed `topicGlossaryMap.json` or empty `matchMap` — the entire section returns `null` and emits a `console.warn`. Quizzes still work; the user just doesn't see a Learn These Words panel.
- All inputs (`topicKey`, `topicGlossaryMap`, `matchMap`) are type-checked before use to prevent accidental throws.
- Returns `null` early if `topicKey` is missing/non-string, or if either data source is missing/non-object.

Limitations introduced in v1.3: None (functionally additive on top of v1.2).

Pre-existing limitations (from Phase 1/2) carried forward unchanged.

Testing performed: Self-review only (no automated tests exist). User instructed that the dev server and backend remain running, so no live browser tests were executed.

### v1.4 (Phase 3 follow-up 2 — "Word Explorer" split-panel repositioning)

Date: 2026-07-09

Summary: Replace the previous "Learn These Words" disclosure (button → dropdown-feel panel → floating tooltips on each word) with a calmer mini learning workspace called "Word Explorer". Clicking the toggle expands a split panel: LEFT = vertical word list (navigation); RIGHT = reading area that is itself the definition viewer (NO floating tooltip, NO nested popover, NO dropdown menu styling). The "Word Explorer" button is positioned at the top-right corner of the App container (`.card`), and the split-panel drops down absolutely below it. In-question glossary behavior is preserved unchanged.

Files Changed:
- `client/src/components/KeyTerms.jsx` — full rewrite (~150-180 lines). Internal component name unchanged. Default export and `{ topicKey }` prop interface unchanged. New internal state: `isOpen` (panel) + `selectedKey` (canonical term name of the selected word). Auto-sets `selectedKey` to the first entry's term when the panel opens via `useEffect` watching `isOpen`. Renders the panel as a 2-column CSS Grid layout. Renders the right pane as plain `<h4>{term}</h4>` + `<p>{definition}</p>` (no tooltip, no popover). Fail-safe try/catch around the `validEntries` resolution is preserved.
- `client/src/App.css` — made `.card` `position: relative` and styled `.word-explorer` (anchored absolutely at `top: 48px; right: 40px;` of the card) and `.word-explorer-panel` (drops down absolutely below the button, aligns left-edge on wide screens, aligns right-edge on standard viewports to stay inside the card, and stacks vertically on mobile).

Files NOT Modified (intentional, per user spec):
- `client/src/components/GlossaryText.jsx` — UNCHANGED. The in-question floating tooltip remains.
- `client/src/data/glossaryTerms.json` — UNCHANGED.
- `client/src/data/topicGlossaryMap.json` — UNCHANGED.
- `client/src/App.jsx` — UNCHANGED. All 65 `<KeyTerms topicKey="X" />` wirings keep working.
- `server/index.js`, `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `client/src/index.css` — UNCHANGED.

Breaking Changes: None.

Migration Required: None.

User-facing rename only (per user spec):
- `"Learn These Words"` → `"Word Explorer"` in the toggle button label.
- Internal component name `KeyTerms` and CSS classes `.learn-these-words*` are NOT renamed.

Design decisions (confirmed with user this session):

- **Split-panel layout** (2 columns desktop, stacked vertical on mobile):
  - LEFT: vertical list of curated terms; each row is a navigation button.
  - RIGHT: reading area — heading (term) + paragraph (definition). The right pane IS the explanation viewer — NOT a tooltip, NOT a popover.
- **Auto-select first word on open** — when the panel opens, the first curated term is automatically selected and its definition is shown in the right pane. Never show an empty panel.
- **Clicking the already-selected word is a no-op** — word stays selected; right pane unchanged.
- **Selected word visual** — full-row accent background fill (`--clr-accent-soft` background + `--clr-accent` text + `--clr-accent` border). Consistent with the existing chip-highlight pattern.
- **Right pane typography** — simple hierarchy: term as `<h4>` heading, definition as `<p>` body.
- **Missing definition fallback** — if a selected term somehow has no definition (defensive), render `"Definition unavailable."` in the right pane. Never crash.
- **No search input** — list is small (3-8 words).
- **Independent scrolling** — left list scrolls internally if content overflows; right pane stays fixed-height (no scroll). Prevents the right pane from jumping as the student browses the list.
- **No animations on word selection** — only the panel-opening slide-in plays. Word selection is instant.
- **Responsive layout** — CSS Grid `grid-template-columns: auto 1fr` on desktop. Below a breakpoint (panel width too small for split), stacks via `grid-template-columns: 1fr`. No hardcoded widths — adapts naturally. Panel max-width capped at `min(640px, calc(100vw - 32px))`.
- **Generous whitespace** — prioritize readability over compactness; tall rows, comfortable padding, clear typography hierarchy.
- **Reuse existing glossary data only** — `topicGlossaryMap.json` + `matchMap` from `GlossaryText.jsx`. No new data files. No changes to `glossaryTerms.json`. No changes to `topicGlossaryMap.json`.
- **In-question glossary UNCHANGED** — `<GlossaryText>` floating tooltip at the 14 in-question wiring sites continues to work exactly as it does today.
- **Fail-safe** — if reading data throws or returns zero valid entries, the entire `<KeyTerms>` returns `null`. Quizzes still work.

Data flow (planned):

1. App setup page mounts → calls `<KeyTerms topicKey="trigonometry" />`.
2. `KeyTerms` (in a try/catch) reads `topicGlossaryMap.json` and `matchMap`, resolves each key, dedupes, deduces `validEntries`.
3. If zero valid entries (or data load throws) → returns `null` → entire section hidden, quizzes still work.
4. Otherwise renders a `<button>Word Explorer ({N}) ▾</button>`.
5. On click, panel state flips to open; an anchored `<div className="word-explorer">` appears below the button.
6. The panel has a 2-column CSS Grid layout:
   - LEFT: vertical list of words. Each item is a `<button>` that calls `setSelectedKey(entry.term)`.
   - RIGHT: definition viewer — `<h4>{selectedEntry.term}</h4>` + `<p>{selectedEntry.definition}</p>` (or `"Definition unavailable."` if missing).
7. On panel open, `useEffect` watches `isOpen` and auto-sets `selectedKey` to the first entry's term. Right pane immediately shows that term's definition.
8. User clicks a word on the left → `selectedKey` updates → right pane re-renders. Panel stays open. Clicking the already-selected word is a no-op.
9. Panel closes on: (a) toggle button click, (b) document mousedown/touchstart outside the wrapper, (c) Escape key.
10. Mobile: when panel effective width is too small for split, the 2 columns stack vertically via a media query on `grid-template-columns`.

Edge cases (planned):

- **No curated terms for topic** → entire component returns `null`. Toggle button hidden.
- **All listed terms missing from glossary** → silently filtered; component then returns `null`.
- **Data files malformed / missing** → wrapped in try/catch, `console.warn`, `return null`.
- **Selected term somehow has no definition** (defensive) → render `"Definition unavailable."` in right pane.
- **User toggles panel open/closed rapidly** → outside-click listener attached / detached via the 10 ms setTimeout pattern (mirrors `GlossaryTooltip`).
- **Click outside panel** → wrapperRef.contains check → setIsOpen(false).
- **Press Escape while panel open** → keydown listener → setIsOpen(false).
- **Click word while another is selected** → updates selectedKey; right pane re-renders; panel stays open (no close).
- **Click already-selected word** → no-op (state stays the same).
- **Empty / no right pane state** → impossible by design — auto-select on open guarantees a term.

Limitations: None introduced (functionally additive on top of v1.3).

Testing performed: Self-review pending after implementation; no automated tests exist. User instructed that the dev server and backend remain running, so no live browser tests will be executed until review time.
