/**
 * studyMode.js — the single source of truth for Explore vs. Focus mode.
 *
 * Focus Mode exists for one situation: a student with an exam coming up who
 * opens Tenali to revise three topics and instead meets a map, a motivation
 * banner, a guided journey, a search bar and sixty puzzle cards. Everything
 * that's good for a browsing learner is noise for a revising one.
 *
 * So this is deliberately NOT a permission system. There's no lock, no
 * gate, no route bouncing, no confirmation to leave. A student turns it on
 * for themselves and turns it off the same way — the only thing it does is
 * take the distractions off the screen. Building enforcement here would
 * mean designing against the student, when the student is the one asking
 * for the help.
 *
 * Two things persist, both in localStorage, both independent:
 *   - the mode itself ('explore' | 'focus')
 *   - the chosen focus topics (an array of prerequisiteGraph topic ids)
 * Keeping the topic list around after leaving Focus Mode is intentional:
 * coming back mid-revision should resume, not re-ask.
 *
 * Cross-component sync uses a `tenali-study-mode-change` CustomEvent, the
 * same pattern already used by `tenali-auth-change` and
 * `tenali-mastery-celebration` — the toggle lives in the app shell but the
 * screens that react to it are several layers down, and they are not
 * connected by props.
