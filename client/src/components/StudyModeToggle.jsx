/**
 * StudyModeToggle.jsx — the Explore / Focus switch in the app shell.
 *
 * Sits in the top bar next to the theme toggle and is visible on every
 * screen, including inside a quiz — a student who realises mid-revision
 * that they're being pulled around shouldn't have to navigate home to calm
 * the app down.
 *
 * Flipping to Focus with no topics chosen yet doesn't ask anything here;
 * it just sets the mode, and <FocusHome> shows the picker. That keeps the
 * toggle a toggle rather than something that opens a modal over whatever
 * the student was doing.
